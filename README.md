# Lab-Activity-LCM-Tower
The first activity was about finding the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of given numbers. It helped us understand how to identify multiples and find the smallest number that two or more numbers share. The second activity was about solving the Tower of Hanoi puzzle. This task taught us how to move disks between poles step by step without placing a larger disk on top of a smaller one. Both activities improved our logical thinking and problem-solving skills.

Through the LCM, I learned how to find the smallest common multiple of two or more numbers. It helped me improve my skills in listing multiples and identifying patterns in numbers. In the Tower of Hanoi activity, I learned how to apply logical steps to move disks correctly from one pole to another. This activity enhanced my critical thinking and taught me the importance of planning ahead. Overall, both activities developed my problem-solving skills and deepened my understanding of mathematical concepts.
